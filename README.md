# Calculator app
Standart iOS calculator app written without storyboard - elements placed only by using code. </br>
FUN FACT - you can download it and install it on your iPad, in that case, you will have a calculator app on Ipad üòé. </br>

## Description

This app is almost a 1:1 copy of the original iOS calculator app. </br>
I have tried to recreate UI and all functionality (only in portrait mode). </br>
All operations that can be done on original app user can also do here. </br></br>

UI have been desinged fully using code files. </br></br></br>

Made with ‚ô•Ô∏è in Swift.
